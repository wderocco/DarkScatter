# DarkScatter
Dark matter scattering rates in astrophysical media including collective effects.


This repository contains the code associated with "Dark matter scattering in astrophysical media: collective effects" by W. DeRocco, M. Galanis, and R. Lasenby (2022, https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05167). It will be updated continually as more functions are added.

At present, it contains code for vector self-energies in dilute, non-relativistic plasmas, and in degenerate Fermi gases.
